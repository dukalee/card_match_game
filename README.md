# Card Match Game

Made for teaching python programming.

## How to Play 

The main purpose of the game is to get rid of all your cards as soon as possible.\
You are able to throw away from your hands when you have a matching pair of numbers. 
You will pick a card from an opponent of your choice, trying to find a matching pair for the cards which remain in your hands. 

It would be in your best interest to avoid having JOKER in your hands, because it will be a big disadvantage as it will be impossible to discard unless an opponent takes that card away from your hands.
